## Overview

- Most of these timesaves are made with my inventory and keybinds in mind.
- These assume you know the route already.
- Make sure you are comfortable hotkeying every hotbar slot.
  - Much of the optimizations work under the assumption that accessing a hotbar
    item is instantaneous.

## Zoom in/out

![Zoom out](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55cccdee-9636-4c2b-a754-a7dad436c594)

Make sure you have map zoom in/out accessible. While you are
walking or digging to the pyramid, you can zoom out on the map to plan out:

- Which trees you want to bomb for housing
  - Whether you'll relog or travel back from the trees
- Identify waterleaf locations
- I have zoom in/out bound to R and B. Having them be accessible from WASD is
  nice, as it allows you to study the map while walking.

## Housing

### Workbench

- Scroll to workbench
  - Tables are 1 slot above workbeches in the crafting wheel.
- Always move a workbench into the hotbar (3 slot for me).
  - After placing the workbench down, you should have the 3 slot open.
  - Throw tables
  - Close inventory to move chairs into hotbar
  - Throw walls
  - See "1 free hotbar slot" section for an example.

### 0 free hotbar slots

![[0 Hotbar Slots.mp4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55cccdee-9636-4c2b-a754-a7dad436c594)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbubby3309/Classic-ML-Optimizations/main/assets/0 Hotbar Slots.mp4)

- Walls and tables will most likely be adjacent in your inventory.
- After building the frame of the house, throw walls and grab the table to the
  edge.
  - Chair should already be in hotbar (slot 3).
- Place tables, then chairs. You'll pick up the walls after placing chairs and
  they'll fill the vacant hotbar slot that the chairs were in (3).

### 1 free hotbar slot

![[1 Hotbar Slot.mp4]]

- After throwing the tables and walls, throw an item from your inventory before
  walking left.
  - Chairs should be in the workbench slot, while tables/walls will occupy the
    free slot and the thrown item slots in the hotbar.

### Initial table placement

- Place the first table on jungle side. This way, you will finish placing
  torches on jungle side and save some travel distance.
  - If you forget to do this, you can achieve a similar result by placing
    torches right after finishing the walls for each house, rather than doing
    another pass to place torches.
- Placing the first table towards the outside of the house lets you place the
  chair 1 block closer.
  - Table is 1 block further, in exchange for the chair being 3 blocks closer.
  
  ![Close Chair](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9014dd9-9cb7-410a-a587-35f88b8add31)![Far Chair](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caef6ee6-6b09-4b51-b798-bb1980023658)



### Wall Placement

![[Wall Placement.mp4]]

- In some configurations, multiple walls may be placed at once.
- Placing the outer frame, then wiggling for the inner walls is a simple method
  of abusing this mechanic.

## Deposit All

- Favorite items that you'll want to have before shimmer.
  - Shimmer is the next and only time you're guaranteed to be able to withdraw
    items from your piggy bank.
  - Before hellevator, you'll want to use "Deposit All" to move items into the
    piggy. Favorited items aren't deposited into the piggy.
    - An alternative is tossing items that you don't want deposited before you
      press "Deposit All". However, throwing incurs use-time and can't be
      overlapped with other splits (jungle and selling items).

## Jungle Inventory

- Move 1 piece of wood to wherever you'll keep it later.
  - When you grab wood from your hotbar and close your inventory, it will
    automatically stack to the single piece of wood.
- Keep 1 recall, a door, and sand in a cluster.
  - The 1 recall serves the same purpose as the 1 piece of wood - to act as an
    existing stack for when you throw recalls out during bed crafting.
  - The cluster minimizes cursor movement during hell bedwarp - you'll need to
    grab recalls, sand and a door consecutively.
- Finish the split with the crafting wheel at the bottom.
  - Chains, which you'll likely craft in the next segment, are usually at the
    bottom of this wheel.

## HP Management

- Stay at 100 HP if you have Boomstick and no Arms Dealer.
  - Nurse isn't needed until N2. Arms Dealer's presence can make Clockwork
    Assault Rifle usable
- Don't go above 180HP until nighttime.
  - Blood Moons are a nuisance, and EoC spawn when you're travelling to Dungeon
    means a reset or relog.

## Water Bottles

- Water bottles sandwiched between sticky glowsticks and flaming arrows. You
  can pre-emptively scroll to one of these if you're about to craft water
  bottles.
- With water-walking + Hermes or with carpet, you can stay just above the water
  to craft water bottles.
- Bucket should be crafted before hellevator to maximize opportunities to grab
  lava without losing time.
  - A water bucket can be used instead to craft bottles while farming bones if
    needed.

## Hell Bedwarp

### Surface Bed Crafting

![[Bed Workbench.mp4]]

- Keg is directly above loom in the crafting wheel.
- Workbench is directly above bed.
- Move workbench and bed to your hotbar in order to make the hell bedwarp
  faster.
  - After crafting silk, click the crafting menu button.
    - This lets you look for workbench in the menu while throwing items.
    - This also saves you from moving the cursor to the left an extra time to
      open the crafting menu.
  - Throw out your fall damage hotbar slot and your recall potions.
    - For me these are 9 and 0.
    - You'll need throw bound to a key near WASD to feasibly do this. I use T
      for throw.
  - Move workbench and bed into the hotbar by closing your inventory. They
    should go into the 2 vacant hotbar slots.
- If you don't have enough iron for a sawmill, you should instead move
  workbench and anvil into your hotbar.

### Regular Hell Bedwarp

![[Regular Hellbed.mp4]]

- Build the frame of the house, then place workbench and bed (and set your
  spawn).
- Jump up and build the frame for the door.
  - Your cursor should already be at the center of the screen.
- Move sand and recalls into your hotbar by closing your inventory. Then, grab
  the door and place it.
  - You should only reach into your inventory once during this.
  - The sand, recalls and door should all be in one cluster.
- Move the guide while the house is still valid. Then, mine the platform and
  bedwarp.

### Underworld Bed Crafting + Bedwarp

![[Bedless Hellbed.mp4]]

- Trash items so that you have at least 2 free inventory slots.
- Scroll to the bottom of the crafting wheel.
  - Furnace is close to the bottom.
- This process is better explained in video. I'll go over some of the less
  obvious stuff.
  - Anvil should be placed on the 2 platforms so that it's mined alongside
    usual platform that's removed for bedwarping.
  - While crafting silk, do a full jump to land on the top of the house.
    - Similarly to crafting the bed on surface, click the crafting menu button
      right after crafting silk so that you can overlap looking for bed with
      throwing items and save some cursor travel.
  - Throwing the iron bars and chain needs to be done before building the door
    frame, as the frame will block the items.
  - The process of moving sand and recalls into the hotbar, placing the door,
    and moving the Guide is the same as the regular setup.

## Skeletron

![[Skeletron Crafting.mp4]]

- After the spin attack, try to set up the next dynamite portion at the same
  height as Skeletron.
  - This lets you set up earlier without worry of luring Skeletron upwards and
    out of range of dynamite.
- While waiting for Skeletron to die, you can craft a needed item.
  - Usually I craft bucket or furnace.
  - If you want to do this, you'll want to move the required crafting station
    into your hotbar (I use slot 9, which has acted as a flex slot thus far).
- Remove double jumps if you have a carpet - they slow down your descent.
  - Don't do this if you have featherfall activer or Umbrella.
- Move Umbrella into your hotbar so that you can fall without pausing to
  levitate or double jump.

## Dungeon

- Move lava bucket into the flex slot (9) to kill Guide.
  - Having bucket in the hotbar is also nice for obtaining lava again during
    Hellstone.
- Put bones in your piggy bank (but only if you can remember how many are in
  there). This lets you quick stack bones after WoF to save an inventory slot.

## Pickaxe timesave

![[Pickaxe Throw.mp4]]

- Best strat in the game.
- Throw your pickaxe, then craft your 20 Hellstone bars and close your
  inventory, then craft the Molten Pickaxe.
  - The Molten Pickaxe should be in the slot your original pickaxe was.
  - Throwing out obsidian so that you have exactly 20 makes it so that you can
    craft Hellstone Bars carelessly.
- The same thing can be done with the drill.

## Missing component for Molten Pickaxe.

- If you still need a Hellforge/Shadow Chest/Fireblossom, do the further soul
  first so that you can explore more new ground before the 2nd set of souls.
- You should be looking for Hellforges while waiting for dynamite to detonate.

## Hotbar Pwnhammer

- Pwnhammer should be in the hotbar for altars. I replace rope with it (8
  slot).
  - Using auto-select requires you to start hammering only after your cursor is
    already over the altar. If you auto-select too early, you'll start placing
    torches instead.
- After altars, move Hellforge to the hammer slot (8) and anvil to the lava
  bucket slot (9).
  - You shouldn't need to reach into your inventory at all to craft the drill
    - Use the same Pickaxe throw technique for the drill (you'll need to pick
      up the Molten Pickaxe this time).

## Souls Hotbar

![Souls Hotbar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86a53ac1-a3eb-4349-bafe-24f944803fd4)


- To build the souls setup, you'll need:
  - Water Candle
    - 6 slot instead of the axe.
  - Junction Boxes
    - 8 slot instead of rope/hammer.
  - Crimstone
    - 9 slot, up until now it's pretty much acted as a flex slot.
  - Chest/Hardmode Ore
    - 0 slot instead of recalls.
- Some of these can be moved into the hotbar during ores/altars.
  - Because you use recalls directly before souls, you won't be able to overlap
    moving the chest most of the time. You can move these into the 0 slot during
    the first set of souls so that you have them for the second.
    - If you don't have 2 chests or extra ore, you can place a throwaway item
      like rope in the 0 slot. This allows you to simply toss the rope out when
      you want to move the chest into the hotbar, so you can close your inventory
      to move the chest into the vacant slot instead of moving the cursor to it.
- Plan ahead for the upcoming segment.
  - Craft and move rails to the 6 slot (if you have Featherfall for teriyaki;
    else axe).
  - Craft minecart if needed.
  - Move recalls back to 0 slot.
  - If you have teleportation potions, move them into the hotbar.
    - I put them into the 9 slot (where booster rails will go next).
  - Unfavorite crimstone blocks (9 slot for me). This way, you can throw them
    out of your hotbar while talking to Mechanic.

## Pre-Shimmer Purchases

- Buying items before selling gives you time to think about what you want to
  sell.
- Buy regular mana potions rather than lesser ones, as they're closer to the
  anvils and arrows
- Throw out the item in the slot you want to move booster rails into (9 for me)
  while talking to Mechanic so that you can move them into that slot by closing
  your inventory.

## Teriyaki

![Separate Booster Tracks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b87b785d-8895-4d2e-b683-da371f12b447)


- Build the teriyaki towards Dungeon-side first.
  - This makes for a quicker escape if you have a solar eclipse after Golem,
    and overlaps the build time with waiting for nighttime.
  - Building Dungeon-side first lets you take the Jungle-side rails directly
    after building them, rather than having to grapple back to them after
    building Dungeon-side.
- Build two separate teriyakis so you don't have to be precise in mounting.
  - Dropping down to build the second one is more consistent, as it doesn't
    require a double jump or hooking.

## Pre-shimmer Inventorying

- Craft a workbench.
- Scroll to the bottom - Mythril and Orichalcum bars are just above coins.
- Move piggy into hotbar (0 slot for me, replaces recalls).
- Move anvils and Hellforge to the bottom right
- This is the closest position to the center of the screen.
- Before arriving at shimmer, move bed and workbench to hotbar.
- I replace junction boxes and booster rails with these (8 and 9).
- A good time to do this is while you're waiting for dynamite to explode after
  finding shimmer.
- Clear out the top ammo slot so you can shift-click ichor arrows into the slot
  later.
- If you still need bullets, you should clear all of the slots to maximize the
  chance of picking up bullets.

## Shimmer

### Build

#### Dry

![[Dry Shimmer build.mp4]] 

#### Flooded

![[Flooded Shimmer Build.mp4]]

- I use an "old" version of the shimmer house rather than any iterations that I
  developed afterwards, simply because the top compartment for this one is
  aligned enough with the bottom such that I don't need to move out of the house
  to pick up items.
- You should learn shimmer housing for both flooded and dry shimmer.
- Place bed, torch and workbench after building the frame.
- You want Mechanic at shimmer so that you can overlap shimmering with
  purchasing.
- Freeing up a house is also makes it more likely for Arms Dealer to move in,
  and allows Dryad to move in (makes Mechs and Moon Lord fight easier).
- Grab the Hellforge and close your inventory, then grab the anvil (which
  should be adjacent to the Hellforge) and place it. Finally, place the Hellforge
  (which should be in the hotbar).
- If you have to shimmer Orichalcum, move Mechanic into the house in the mean
  time.
- Performing an action that has a use-animation as the ore finishes shimmering
  can cause it to shimmer again.
- Craft the Mythril/Orichalcum bars and close your inventory, then do the same
  with the hardmode anvil. The bars and hardmode anvil should move into the
  hotbar slot previously occupied by Hellforge/anvil - The hardmode anvil should
  be in your hotbar now, so you can place it down without reaching into your
  inventory.
- Shimmer emblem before anything else, as it's the only item that will require
  multiple shimmers.
- If you still need ores, shimmer potions and craft spelunker before leaving.
- If you still need bullets, get them now. You need Arms Dealer by tonight
  (since Golem dies N2).
- Don't consume Life Crystals, Ambrosia, builder potions yet - that can be
  overlapped with Destroyer.

### Crafting

![[Shimmer Crafting.mp4]]

- Since you're at the bottom of the scroll menu, this should be the initial
  crafting phase:
- Mech summons
- Minecart (if needed)
- Molten Chestplate
- Cooking Pot
- Open the crafting menu for ichor arrows - they're at the very front.
- Open the menu for rails
- Since the piggy menu is closer, you'll want to shift-click items into your
  hotbar rather than dragging each one there.
- Replace your weapon (3) with walls (unfavorited).
- Iron gates are walls that can be crafted at an anvil. They're just above
  rails in the crafting wheel.
- Turn on ruler for the Destroyer split.
- Grab Pwnhammer (1)
- Trash platforms if you're planning to craft stone platforms.
- Clear out 8, 9, 0 slots (bed, workbench, and piggy slots from the start of
  this split) by shift-clicking them.
- Click on sand to place Pwnhammer in its place and move sand to the bottom row
  of your piggy.
- Next set of crafting:
- Glass
- Stone bricks (should be just below glass)
- Stone platforms (scroll up from stone bricks)
- Mugs (scroll up from stone platforms)
- Shift-click these items into your hotbar
- Sand (1, previously Pwnhammer)
- Stone platforms (5)
- Cooking Pot (8)
- Keg (9)
- Bottle/Alchemy Table (0)
- Having all of these crafting stations in the hotbar minimizes the time you
  spend awake.
- Place the Cooking Pot, Keg, and potion crafting station.
- Finish your hotbar
- Junction boxes (8)
- Hardmode ore (9)
- Recalls (0)
- Third set of crafting (consumables)
- Ale is near the top
- Seafood dinner x2
- Regeneration x2
- Ironskin x2
- Featherfall x 2
- Archery x3
- If you're low on Daybloom, craft Featherfalls first. It's the only necessary
  one.
- Builder
- Battle (if you need feathers)
- Dangersense (find temple and open space)
- Night Owl
- Spelunker (same as dangersense)
- Zoom in on overlay map
- This makes Destroyer kill more consistent.
- Scroll to the bottom of the crafting wheel.
- Your next craft will be Hallowed Jousting Lance.

## Destroyer

- If she's not there yet, move Nurse into her house.
- You only need a single wall to stop Wyvern spawns.
- While throwing dynamite, zoom out on your overlay map again.
- Don't turn off ruler yet, you'll want it for building the lance mechs setup.
- Life Crystals, Ambrosia, builder potions can be used here.
- Move an expendable item into the 7 and 9 slots (dynamite and hardmode ore).
- You don't want these to be empty, since you don't want Destoyer loot here.
- You'll want to vacate these slots when talking to Mechanic to allocate space
  for wrench and switches. Trashing is easier than throwing, since throwing has
  cooldown.
- If you didn't scroll to the bottom earlier, now is a good time.

## Mechanic/Reforging

- Buy and throw:
  - Yellow Wrench - it's the closest one
  - Switch x2
  - Teleporter x2
- Trash the two ichor arrows so the wrench and switches go into your hotbar
  - If you're too slow, they'll go into your inventory instead.
- Overlap shimmering with buying wire, pressure plates, and mechanical lens
  (optional).
  - If you finish purchasing/selling before shimmering, you can also overlap
    setting up the torch bedwarp.
- If you're using Nurse for Golem, you don't need a very good lance. I'd take
  Hurtful+.

## Mechs Setup

![[Mechs Prep.mp4]]

- Trash sand and walls, then move Pwnhammer and Hardmode Anvil into your hotbar
  by grabbing them and closing your inventory.
- Mine a table next to the Merchant (or place 3 platforms) to place the
  Sharpening Station on.
  - It's faster to place the floor for the station first then talk to the
    Merchant (saves cursor movement).
- Sell the Sharpening Station, then grab Teleporters > Recalls > Anvil, and
  place the anvil down directly.
- The order I build things in is better explained by video than text.
  - I do think that this way of building the Mechs setup is far more efficient
    than any I've seen from other runners, so I recommend copying it exactly.
- Placing the switch to the side of the teleporter makes the smart cursor
  positioning more lenient.
  - In particular, placing your cursor over the heal button position and
    right-clicking will talk to the Nurse rather than teleporting.
    - I only ever do right-side Guide house for this category.
- Move to the right while building the right-side wall. When you mount to the
  rails from the right, there's no chance of you being throw off, and you won't
  need to double-tap a direction key.

## Mechs

- You don't need to disable ruler - it won't show up when you're moving
  quickly.
- Summon Prime before Twins
  - Prime is your main focus, and you want him to stabilize as early as
    possible.
- Craft the helmet and close your inventory, then craft the two pressure plate
  tracks.
  - Don't close your inventory after crafting the tracks, as they'll go into
    your hotbar. Instead, mouse over the helmet, then right click and left click
    to equip the helmet and place the tracks.
- You should have two empty hotbar slots where the switches and teleporters
  were. At least one repeater should go directly into your hotbar via closing
  your inventory.
- Try to overlap heals with moments where Prime is too high to hit (this
  happens after its spinning attack).
- Most of the time, it's better to craft an extra repeater for a better reforge
  than to craft Greaves. A better repeater affects not only this fight, but
  pillars as well.
  - I don't have stats to back this up.
  - If you use Nurse Golem (which I think you should for an overwhelming
    majority of runs), you won't shimmer your repeater in order to craft the
    Hallowed Chestplate.
- Focus Retinazer for the most part, since Spazmatism takes collateral from the
  minecart.
  - Try your best to land instakill, it doesn't matter if you kill Retinazer
    before Spazmatism. You don't want to wait for another Retinazer cycle.

## Pre-Plantera

### Logic Sensor setup

![[Logic Sensor.mp4]]

- Place the Hardmode anvil at shimmer and throw one of the 9 and 0 slots.
  - These are the slots you had teleporter and switches in. Only one of these
    slots will be the repeater you want to keep, and the other is free to toss
    into shimmer.
- Craft the logic sensor and close your inventory so that it goes into your
  hotbar. Then, craft the active stone block and place it directly.
  - This lets you setup the logic sensor bedwarp without reaching into your
    inventory.
- You can leave the anvil at shimmer if you're going for N2 Golem.
- Equip armor while teriyakiing rather than straight away.

### Inventory

![Plantera Inventory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2679411f-305a-4c80-b12f-3c0dd1b36bed)

- Move teleporters and dynamite to the bottom right of your inventory (closest
  to center of screen).
  - Move pressure plate tracks to the hotbar (0 slot).
  - You should still have wrench in your hotbar.
- Move wire out of your ammo slot so it's easier to pick up Rockets.
- Turn off the ruler during the teriyaki if it bothers you.

## Plantera

![[Chair Crafting.mp4]]

- If you're going for a good time, go directly to temple, or look for where you
  think temple would most likely be rather than looking for Plantera's bulb.
  - You kinda need bulb on route to temple optimally.
- Place the straight line of wire first, then throw/trash the wrench. Move
  teleporters into this slot by closing your inventory.
  - Do this while waiting for dynamite to detonate.
- While Plantera is spawning, craft a workbench and chair (if you're doing
  Nurse Golem).
  - You should have two empty hotbar slots from the teleporters and pressure
    plate tracks, so the items should go straight into the hotbar.
- If you're doing fast Golem, move honey bucket and a campfire into your hotbar
  instead.
  - I don't ever do regen Golem.
- Clear out ammo slots to make it easier to verify when you've picked up
  Rockets.
- Clear out your inventory to make sure you can pick up temple chest loot.

## Golem

- If you're doing Nurse Golem, you can tank damage without issue.
  - Looting 2 chests will guarantee a Solar Eclipse Tablet.
- You don't need to build a very long ceiling.
- Move anvil (if you brought it, else booster tracks) and recalls into your
  hotbar while accelerating for fast Golem.
  - For Nurse Golem, move them into hotbar while moving offscreen for Nurse to
    move in.
  - I move Anvil > 9, repeater > 7, recalls > 0

## Cultist

![[Cultist Setup.mp4]]

- Move booster track into your hotbar after placing the anvil (if needed).
- Move unholy arrows to the top ammo slot (unfavorited).
- Move return potion to your hotbar in place of recalls (if applicable).
- Move Nurse back to spawn (if applicable).
- The cultist setup shown here is the most efficient way of building it.
- Build the ceiling for the setup while the Cultist is spawning.
- If you're confident you can end the fight before another Lightning Orb
  attack, you can mine the blocks above you while the clones are spawning.
  - This may help for pillars.
- Calculate whether you can have full hallowed for Vortex first.

## Pillars

![[Red Square.mp4]]

- Hallowed helmets are just under the red square in the crafting wheel. Scroll
  to them if you're waiting for hallowed bars to craft a helmet.
- Equip armor while teriyakiing rather than straight away.
- Use zoom in/out keybinds to examine the pillars layout during your first
  pillar.
  - Also plan out your upcoming shimmer segment - weapons, helmet, emblem,
    alchemy table.
- Trash unholy arrows while Vortex is dying.
- For the close pillars, I build one side at a time, but build them connected.
  - This makes it easy to mount to the regular rail on the other side for when
    you need to teriyaki the other way.
- During your last two pillars, plan out what you'll need to shimmer for Moon
  Lord.
  - You should realistically always be able to use Sigil.
- Move Ancient Manipulator (if it isn't at shimmer) and bewitching table into
  your hotbar during the last pillar.
- If you can't tell already, a lot of this segment is just planning ahead
  during downtime. You shouldn't waste any time at shimmer making decisions.

### Vortex first

- Move Ancient Manipulator into your hotbar while teriyakiing.
  - This lets you craft Phantasm more quickly.
- During stardust, leave a hotbar slot open.
  - This lets you place the banner more quickly.
  - You should prepare a platform to place the banner when you have time,
    positioned such that it doesn't impede you when blocking yourself off to kill
    the pillar.
  - Make sure you know how to drain liquids with a honey bucket and coins.

### Stardust first

![[Stationary Dragon.mp4]]

- I generally don't do Stardust first with unexplored sky or if I have to pass
  an island, as it can get out of hand easily.
- Stynger destroys the pillar very quickly.
- Stynger, Golem Fist and Possesed Hatchet are better than repeater for killing
  mobs (when you're trying to isolate a cell).
- If you aggro the dragon onto the pillar and then summon it directly on top,
  it will stay still and continually deal damage.

## Moon Lord

- Attempt to summon Eclipse at shimmer if needed. She will be guaranteed to
  move in this way.
- You can leave Nurse menu open for most of it.
  - Leaving it open lets you know ahead of time where to aim, whereas you'd
    have to react if you only talk to her right before healing.
- Daybreak stacks up to 8 times per target; try to spread the DoT.
